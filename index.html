                    <h2>Java</h2>
                    <p>While I wouldn't consider myself proficient in advanced Java concepts just yet, my journey with the language has been incredibly valuable. I know that mastery takes time, and I'm eager to continue learning and growing. There are plenty of resources available to help me delve deeper into advanced topics if I'm interested, whether it's through online courses, tutorials, books, or hands-on projects. I understand that proficiency in Java, like any language, is a journey, not a destination. So, I'm committed to keep exploring, experimenting, and practicing, knowing that my expertise will naturally grow over time.</p>

                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                    <p>HTML is a relatively new endeavor for me, but I found it surprisingly easy to grasp the basics. I'm currently in the process of honing my skills by building a website, which has been an exciting hands-on experience. Despite being new to HTML, I'm motivated to learn more and explore its possibilities further. I'm aware that there's still much to discover and understand about this markup language, but I'm enjoying the journey of discovery and experimentation. Building this website has been a great way for me to apply what I've learned so far and to continue expanding my knowledge of HTML.</p>

                    <h2>CSS</h2>
                    <p>As a beginner in CSS, I've found the journey to be both exciting and rewarding. While I'm still getting to grips with the fundamentals, I've been pleasantly surprised by how quickly I've been able to grasp the basics. Currently, I'm focusing on building a strong foundation by experimenting with different styling techniques and understanding how CSS interacts with HTML to create visually appealing web pages. Despite being at the beginner level, I'm enthusiastic about the learning process and eager to continue exploring CSS to unlock its full potential. Building this website has been a fantastic opportunity for me to practice and reinforce what I've learned so far, and I look forward to furthering my skills as I progress on this journey.</p>

                    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
                    <p>My experience with machine learning has been a journey of exploration and learning. I've taken courses such as Andrew Ng's on Coursera, which provided me with a solid foundation in the theory and concepts of machine learning. Additionally, I've delved into practical implementation by trying to implement algorithms from scratch using Python. While I wouldn't classify myself as an expert in this field, I've gained valuable experience and consider myself to be at a mediocre level. I've also expanded my knowledge through courses on platforms like Udemy and Coursera, further enhancing my understanding of machine learning techniques and methodologies. Despite being at a moderate level, I'm eager to continue learning and improving my skills in machine learning, as I find the field to be both fascinating and full of potential.</p>
